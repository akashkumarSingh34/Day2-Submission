Question
Find the output of the following code snippet: 
int i =0, j = 0;
int *p = &i, *q = &j;
q = p;
*q = 2;
cout<<i<<" "<<j;

OUTPUT:
	2 0
  
EXPLANATION:
int i =0, j = 0;			      //initializing value 0 to ‘i’ and ‘j’
int *p = &i, *q = &j;		    //’p’ points to address of ‘i’ and ‘q’ points to address of ‘j’
q = p;				              //Now ‘q’ points to the address at which p points that is address of ‘i’
*q = 2				              //here first we de-refer the address to which ‘q’ points and assign the value 2 at that location, so now i=2
cout<<i<<" "<<j;		        //prints value stored in ‘i’ and ‘j’ i.e., 2 0
